# Exponential back-off strategy

This is a base class to handle requests and resend them using exponential back-off.

In the source code you will find:

1. The class `BackOffStrategy.java`
2. The unit test`BackOffStrategyTest.java`

Basically, this code gives you an idea of how to implement an exponential back-off strategy to resend a request when there is an unsuccessful call. You can configure the number of retries and the default waiting time. In the unit test you will see some examples of how to use it. You can make it more complex according your development requirements (handle custom exceptions, wait more time,  add some custom logic, etc).

This was my base class for the implementation of:

* A backend webservice with retry logic
* XMPP Connection Server for FCM(Firebase Cloud Messaging)

##Technology used

 * Java 8
 * JUnit
 * Maven
